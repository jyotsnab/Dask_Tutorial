# Dask_Tutorial
DASK is a python based parallel computing and task scheduling Library. 
It's smooth integration with popular python libraries numpy, pandas, sklearn make this an increasingly popular choice for parallel computing.

NOTE: I am not the developer of DASK. It is developed by Continuum Analytics. See http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html for more information.
The intention of this tutorial is to guide a beginner to start using DASK and get a overview about it.
